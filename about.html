                      align="left">Balanced Ternary is a strange base
                      number. It traces far back in computer history,
                      but not much has ever come of it other than a few
                      footnotes. That is until recently, as several
                      small projects such as multiplexers, appeared
                      across the interwebs. </p>

                      align="left">SBTCVM arose out of a curiosity for
                      balanced ternary mathematics and computing, as did
                      libbaltcalc. This reflects heavily in SBTCVM and
                      its overall design, and goals. The learning curve
                      of SBTCVM can be steep. In fact, programming
                      SBTCVM has been a challenge in itself, due to not
                      many resources or tools related to balanced
                      ternary being available. SBTCVM hopes to change
                      that by providing an evolving codebase and design
                      to provide ideas as well as the software tools
                      needed, to develop balanced ternary further. This
                      evolving nature is evident in planned projects
                      such as a portable balanced ternary programming
                      language, and even an operating system for SBTCVM.</p>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"
                      align="left"><br>
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"
                      align="left">The sheer lack of tools and software
                      support for balanced ternary can make itself quite
                      evident. It therefore comes as no surprise to see
                      people so passionate about the smallest balanced
                      base number. It is hoped that SBTCVM can fill much
                      of that void of support and tools. with a powerful
                      integer mathematics backend, and a powerful
                      command shell, and the VM itself, SBTCVM,
                      continues to advance towards more powerful,
                      features and tools. </p>

                      align="left">The lack of advanced balanced ternary
                      hardware isn't helping anything. Sure one could
                      try using discrete components to create a balanced
                      ternary computer. but to say that building 19,683
                      9-trit words of memory using discrete parts is a
                      tad complicated, is an understatement. Hence
                      SBTCVM's virtual machine. SBTCVM uses instruction
                      level simulation for two main reasons. A lack of
                      reference hardware and speed.</p>

                      align="left">To conclude, SBTCVM is moving
                      forward. New features, bugfixes, better
                      documentation, and more.&nbsp; Perhaps some day,
                      Balanced ternary computers will be available to
                      the average curious user, but until then, SBTCVM
                      will continue to advance ever further towards that
                      overreaching goal.<br>
