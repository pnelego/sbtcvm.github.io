                            SBTCVM's predecessor, with the placeholder
                            name "TDA" meaning "Ternary Demo
                            Architecure" literally reffering to the fact
                            that TDA Mark 1 was more of a proof of
                            concept than anything else.<br>
                            <br>
                            It was slow, and clunky. despite the
                            diffrences, The code already had the
                            familiar color and mono displays, the TTY,
                            text encoding, status leds and readout
                            displays. The assembler also started
                            here.&nbsp; Though it remained a bit on the
                            complicated, slow, and clunky side of things
                            overall.<br>
                            <br>
                            some of SBTCVM's various quirks also started
                            here. such as VM SYSHALT.<br>
                            <br>
                            Despite many advancements, Mark 2's
                            architecture specification still traces back
                            to this prototype.<br>

                            SBTCVM mark 1.1 is "ternary-compatible" (so
                            to speak) with old TDA mark 1, as it
                            primarily focused on cleaning up the
                            codebase, and redesigning the User
                            interface.<br>
                            <br>
                            you can also see the old rainbow logo in the
                            margin of the screen. and a strangly placed
                            status light panel. This is due to it not
                            having been moved in time for this
                            screenshot, as SBTCVM Mark 1.1 expaned the
                            window size from 648x486 to 800x600.<br>
                            <br>
                            that logo in the color display is
                            interesting... in the fact that it had to be
                            plotted by hand... This is partly the reason
                            SBTCVM mark 2 has its MK2-GFX.py graphics
                            conversion toolkit.<br>
                            <br>
                            Its also notable for its short development
                            time, and that its less prototype-ish.<br>

                            it has many new features, huge speed
                            improvements.... a far better assembler...
                            more tools, a much more organized overall

                            <br>
                            it introduces many new technologies,
