                    <h3>Notes:</h3>
                    <ul>
                      <li>SBTCVM is written and python, and uses pygame
                        for graphics, sound, user input, etc. knowledge
                        of these helps.</li>
                      <li>SBTCVM is a balanced ternary VM (obviously),
                        so a basic understanding of balanced ternary
                        helps a lot.</li>
                      <li>a basic understanding of digital computers
                        helps; however, binary digital computers and
                        balanced ternary digital computers do have many
                        differences.</li>
                      <li>in general, expert knowledge in balanced
                        ternary, mathematics, computer technology, or
                        other related fields is greatly appreciated and
                        needed in some cases.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3 style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"
                      align="left">reasonably simple:</h3>
                    <ul>
                      <li>GUI calculator using libbaltcalc, and
                        preferably pygame (to avoid additional
                        dependencies.)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3 style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"
                      align="left">complicated:</h3>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Proper, framebuffered display with various
                        advanced features (Simple Balanced Ternary
                        Graphics Adapter (SBTGA))<br>
                      </li>
                      <li>better TTY. (preferably with 3-trit RGB color
                        support, and more intelligent formatting
                        functionality.)<br>
                      </li>
                      <li>mouse support (as a VM device. support for
                        mouse in menus would likely also help)</li>
                      <li>proper keyboard support<br>
                      </li>
                      <li>Virtual Digital audio device. (SBTDAC)<br>
                      </li>
                      <li>Memory viewer. <br>
                      </li>
                      <li>more advanced assembly support. (i.e.
                        library/module support, etc.)</li>
                      <li>memory range copying. (ability to copy large
                        sections of memory more easily)<br>
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>extra complicated:</h3>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Fully working OS. (SBTC-OS)</li>
                      <li>Well designed, portable, balanced ternary
                        programming language, with library/module
                        support. (SBTPL)<br>
                      </li>
                      <li>Virtual Filesystem support of some kind</li>
                      <li>Virtual removable "disks" with filesystem, and
                        related external tools.</li>
                      <li>Balanced ternary floating point support in
                        libbaltcalc. (perhaps offer both true balanced
                        ternary operations, and faster approximate
                        operations) (main challenge will be the
                        high-speed conversion functions.)</li>
                      <li>Balanced ternary fixed point arithmetic
                        support in libbaltcalc. (main goal here is exact
                        accuracy, not speed.)</li>
                      <li>DMA support for IObus devices. useful for
                        SBTDAC and SBTGA especially.</li>
                      <li>move IObus device handling to a concurrent
                        thread. (such as the TTY, user input, SBTDAC
                        and&nbsp; SBTGA)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Research:</h3>
                    <ul>
                      <li>come up with a means of storing balanced
                        ternary floating points using ternary data.</li>
                      <li>look into further what work has been done in
                        the past.</li>
                      <li>plan out basic structure of SBTC-OS. perhaps
                        look at various alternate, simple Operating
                        Systems for inspiration.</li>
                      <li>general hardware research.</li>
                      <li>research various kinds of computer operations
                        and functionality, and how these may translate
                        into SBTCVM and Balanced Ternary Computers in
                        general. <br>
                      </li>
                      <li>look into what kinds of software, functions,
                        and algorithms, SBTCVM can run now, or may be
                        able to run in the future. perhaps libbaltcalc
                        may help?<br>
                      </li>
                    </ul>

                      <li>Help Spread the word of SBTCVM, and help
                        others in learning SBTCVM, tasm, and balanced
                        ternary in general.</li>
                      <li>Proper website. with wiki, and forum. (please
                        contact the dev team if you want to help with
                        this!)</li>
